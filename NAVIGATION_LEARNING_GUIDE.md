## üöÄ How to Run

### Option 1: Navigation Learning Hub (Recommended)
```bash
flutter run lib/navigation_example_runner.dart
```
This shows both options and lets you choose your learning path.

### Option 2: Direct Tutorial
```bash
flutter run lib/tutorial_runner.dart
```
Runs the step-by-step tutorial directly.

### Option 3: Integration with Main App
Add to your app's routes or navigate directly:
```dart
// Step-by-step tutorial
Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => StepByStepNavigationTutorial()),
);

// Advanced example
Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NavigationAnimationExample()),
);
```

## üîç Key Concepts Explained

### Navigation Stack
Think of navigation like a stack of cards:
- **PUSH**: Add a new card on top
- **POP**: Remove the top card, revealing the one underneath

### Animation States
Every navigation animation goes through these states:
1. **DISMISSED (0.0)**: Animation at start position
2. **FORWARD (0.0‚Üí1.0)**: Animation running forward
3. **COMPLETED (1.0)**: Animation at end position  
4. **REVERSE (1.0‚Üí0.0)**: Animation running backward (for pop)

### Animation Values
- **0.0**: Starting position (page completely off-screen)
- **0.25**: 25% of animation complete
- **0.5**: Halfway point
- **0.75**: 75% complete
- **1.0**: End position (page fully visible)

### Primary vs Secondary Animations
During navigation, TWO animations run simultaneously:
- **Primary**: The new page coming in
- **Secondary**: The previous page being covered/uncovered

## üì± Interactive Features

### In the Step-by-Step Tutorial:
- **Animation State Demo**: Control animations manually to see state changes
- **Animation Values Demo**: Watch values change from 0.0 to 1.0 with visual feedback
- **Primary/Secondary Demo**: See both animations running simultaneously
- **Real-time Event Log**: Track every navigation and animation event

### In the Advanced Example:
- **Live Animation Tracking**: See animation frames in real-time
- **Custom Transitions**: Examples of custom page transitions
- **Multi-page Navigation**: Navigate between multiple pages
- **Route Observer**: Implementation of NavigatorObserver
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Real-time animation progress bars

## üé® Code Examples

### Basic Navigation
```dart
// Push a new page
Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NewPage()),
);

// Pop current page
Navigator.of(context).pop();
```

### Tracking Animations
```dart
@override
void didChangeDependencies() {
  super.didChangeDependencies();
  
  final route = ModalRoute.of(context);
  
  // Track primary animation (this page)
  route?.animation?.addListener(() {
    print('Primary value: ${route.animation!.value}');
  });
  
  // Track secondary animation (previous page)
  route?.secondaryAnimation?.addListener(() {
    print('Secondary value: ${route.secondaryAnimation!.value}');
  });
}
```

### Custom Transitions
```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(
  PageRouteBuilder(
    pageBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation) => NewPage(),
    transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
      return SlideTransition(
        position: Tween<Offset>(
          begin: Offset(1.0, 0.0),
          end: Offset.zero,
        ).animate(animation),
        child: child,
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

## üîß Learning Tips

1. **Start with the Tutorial**: If you're new to Flutter navigation, begin with the step-by-step tutorial
2. **Watch the Logs**: Pay attention to the real-time event logs to understand the sequence
3. **Experiment**: Try different navigation patterns and observe the behavior
4. **Compare Examples**: Use both examples to see different perspectives on the same concepts
5. **Practice**: Try implementing your own navigation examples using the patterns shown

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Always handle animation completion**: Use animation callbacks instead of fixed delays
2. **Consider both animations**: Remember that primary and secondary animations run together
3. **Use proper route observers**: Track navigation events for debugging and analytics
4. **Test on real devices**: Animation behavior can differ between simulators and real devices
5. **Handle edge cases**: Consider back button presses, system navigation, etc.

## üêõ Common Issues

1. **Animation stuttering**: Usually caused by heavy computations during animations
2. **Memory leaks**: Remember to dispose animation controllers and remove listeners
3. **State management**: Be careful with widget state during navigation transitions
4. **Platform differences**: iOS and Android have different navigation behaviors
